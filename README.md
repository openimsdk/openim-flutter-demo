OpenIM provides an open-source Instant Messaging (IM) SDK for developers, serving as an alternative solution to cloud services like Twilio and Sendbird. With OpenIM, developers can build secure and reliable IM applications similar to WeChat, Zoom, and Slack.

This repository is based on the open-source version of the OpenIM SDK, offering an Flutter IM application. You can use this application as a reference implementation of the OpenIM SDK.

## Development Environment

Before you start development, ensure that the following software is installed on your system:

- **Operating System**: macOS 15 or later

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-flutter-demo.git
   cd openim-flutter-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Modify the configuration

     > If you have not changed the default server ports, update only the [_host](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-flutter-demo/blob/a309f25fdbc143e49d5ca852171ce57970871c85/openim_common/lib/src/config.dart#L59) to your server IP.

   static const _host = "your-server-ip or your-domain";
   ```

4. Run the application using `flutter run` from the terminal or through your IDE.

5. Start developing and testing! ðŸŽ‰

## Audio/Video Calls

The open-source version supports one-to-one audio and video calls. You need to first deploy and configure the [server](https://github.com/openimsdk/chat/blob/main/HOW_TO_SETUP_LIVEKIT_SERVER.md). For multi-party audio/video calls or video conferencing, please contact us at [contact@openim.io](mailto:contact@openim.io).

}
```
